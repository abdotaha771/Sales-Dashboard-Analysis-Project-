📈 Key Insights from the Data
This analysis synthesizes insights from different states of the dashboard (all-time, 2020-only, and August-specific).

1. Overall Performance (Multi-Year View)
2020 Was the Strongest Year: The multi-year "Revenue vs Budget" chart shows that 2020 (10.21M Revenue) was the only year to significantly meet and exceed its budget (at 109.23%).

Other Years Underperformed: 2019 and 2021 (partial) both appear to be tracking significantly under their respective budgets.

Top Channels Shift: Over the total period, Online (8.7M) is the largest sales channel. However, in 2020, Retail (5.3M) was the dominant channel, suggesting a strategic shift or market change during that year.

2. Deep Dive: 2020 Performance
A Year Saved by Q4: The monthly "Revenue vs Budget" chart for 2020 reveals a critical story. Revenue was below budget for the first nine months (Jan-Sep).

Strong Q4 Finish: An exceptionally strong performance in Q4 (Oct, Nov, Dec) pushed the entire year's revenue significantly above the budget line, resulting in the 109.23% overall success.

Top Products (2020): The top-selling items by name in 2020 were "Product 1968" and "Product 2445."

3. Personnel Performance
Top Supervisors: Diego Araujo and Diogo Carvalho are the consistent top-performing supervisors.

In the 2020 view, they are neck-and-neck, bringing in ~3.2M in revenue each and accounting for a combined 64.46% of all revenue.

In the "All Time" view, they are similarly dominant, contributing 6.3M and 6.0M, respectively.
